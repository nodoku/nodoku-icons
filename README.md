# Nodoku License

The Nodoku License to be used depends on the use case you plan to use Nodoku for:

- using Nodoku to build an End Product, which is a webpage or a website for private or commercial use
  - in short, in this case Nodoku **_is free_** to use under the MIT License (see below for more details)
- using Nodoku to build an End Product, which is a webpage or a website builder (online or offline)
  - in short, in this case the use of Nodoku **_is prohibited_**


Note, that
> in any case of the allowed, free-of-charge use of Nodoku, **_the present Nodoku license should be included in all copies of the Software, using Nodoku_**.



## Use for private, educational or commercial needs, excluding applications for webpage or website building tools

Any use of Nodoku, **_except for webpage and website builder applications_**, is allowed free of charge, under the **_MIT license_**



### License for Nodoku-icons

The [nodoku-icons](https://github.com/nodoku/nodoku-icons) is a Nodoku components bundle, which provides access to the popular set of icons, such as Font Awesome icons.

Each icon set is distributed under their own license terms, hence the Nodoku-icons license reflects this fact.

If you plan to use Nodoku-icons, please consult a particular license for each set of icons, you plan to use, and adapt accordingly.

You need only to respect the license terms for the icon set you plan to use.

You can use each icon set separately, without including all of them in the project, and you'll need to respect the license terms only for the icon set you actually use in the project.

If you plan to use Nodoku icons in your project, please consult the [Nodoku-icons license agreement](https://github.com/nodoku/nodoku-icons/blob/main/LICENSE).


## Use as part of website or webpage builders

The use of Nodoku for the purposes to provide a solution for online (or offline) website or webpage builders is **_prohibited_**.

This prohibition includes the direct or indirect use of the Nodoku library as part of webpage builder solution.

Indirect use of Nodoku library would include building a software that would then be used as part of webpage or website builder.

Webpage or Website builder application is any tool, online or offline, that would allow the End User to build a publishable webpage or website, using no code or low amount of code.

This is prohibited under this license term since that would constitute a direct competition to Nodoku lo-code site builder.
